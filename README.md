Beginner web development project I made for my 1-year anniversary with my partner.

# Description
This web application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an elegant UI that demonstrates the love and care I put into this project. Inside the page, you will find a real-time clock that displays how long my partner and I have been together. Furthermore, you will see a simple image gallery embodying our time together.

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/philbreunig/phillipheartsevey.git
cd phillipheartsevey
```
